# Manrique's implementation of the Open Game List App

This is my implementation of the sample project for the book titled "ASP.NET Core and Angular 2" by Valerio De Sanctis (https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/aspnet-core-and-angular-2).

I did it in order to practice. Some of the technologies used are:

-  Server side:
  -  ASP.NET Core
  -  EntityFramework Core


-  Client side:
  -  Angular 2
  -  LESS
  -  GULP
    
    
-  Tools:
  -  Visual Studio 2015


The app is deployed here:  http://manrique-opengamelist.azurewebsites.net/
